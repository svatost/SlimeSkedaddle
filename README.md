This game was made by me, Trey Svatos, as part of my Capstone Project for graduation!
I had a lot of fun and headaches making this pretty simple game, and while I can't garuantee
that there will be no bugs, I can guarantee that I learned a lot and did my best to minimize any
bugs I created ways for the player to reload and quit the game in case problems occur.
You can find out how to do these by looking at the control guide included on this GitHub!

Thank you again for looking at all this and for playing!

## Windows (.exe)
1. Download and run the .exe file! Nice and easy.

## MacOS (.dmg)
This is a little trickier since Apple is very picky about 3rd party apps.  
If you try and run it by default, it will bring up a message that Apple won't open it due to not being able to check if it's malware (I promise you it isn't!)  
Luckily enough, since I own a Mac and have been through this ringer many times before, I got you covered!  
### Simpliest Way (recommended):
1. Download the .dmg file.
2. Right-click the file and click 'Open', and then 'Open' again on the popup.
3. Viola! Hopefully you'll be able to run the game!

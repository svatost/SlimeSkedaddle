## Windows (.exe)
1. Download and run the .exe file! Nice and easy.

## MacOS (.dmg)
This is a little trickier since Apple is very picky about 3rd party apps.  
If you try and run it by default, it will bring up a message that Apple won't open it due to not being able to check if it's malware (I promise you it isn't!)  
Luckily enough, since I own a Mac and have been through this ringer many times before, I got you covered!  
### Simpliest Way (recommended first, but doesn't always work):
1. Download the .dmg file.
2. Right-click the file and click 'Open', and then 'Open' again on the popup.
3. Enter your password if needed.
4. Viola! Hopefully you'll be able to run the game!
### 2nd Way:
1. Download the .dmg file.
2. Try and execute the game (It will be blocked).
3. Go to system preferences (apple icon in top left -> system settings)
4. Go to Privacy & Security and scroll all the way down.
5. There should be a popup saying to allow the game to run. Click "Open Anyways".
6. Now you can go back to the game and try to run again!
